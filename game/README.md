# csc481-fa22 Game Engine Foundations
   
   This repository contains 5 directories each with one version of a game engine developed
   over the course of a semester of CSC 481.
   Each directory represents the deliverable for one of the five homework assignments,
   with the following functionality respectively.
   
   - [hw1:](https://github.com/MakeWay4DuckLord/game-engine-foundations/tree/main/hw1) Using SFML to open window and facilitate basic character movement
   - [hw2:](https://github.com/MakeWay4DuckLord/game-engine-foundations/tree/main/hw2) Client/server networked multiplayer using ZMQ sockets
   - [hw3:](https://github.com/MakeWay4DuckLord/game-engine-foundations/tree/main/hw3) Component based game object model.
   - [hw4:](https://github.com/MakeWay4DuckLord/game-engine-foundations/tree/main/hw4)  Custom event management system.
   - [hw5:](https://github.com/MakeWay4DuckLord/game-engine-foundations/tree/main/hw5) Scripting system using node js. HW 5 also includes an implementation of a flappy bird like game made with minimal changes to the engine to demonstrate the engines versatility and extensibility.

   Each homework directory contains a readme file with compilation and execution instructions.
